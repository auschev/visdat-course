# Introduction - [Auschev Ruslan]

## About Me

Write a brief introduction about yourself (2-3 paragraphs):
- I did an apprenticeship as a car mechanic afterwards I worked as 
cnc technicians in series production of car parts. At the same time I did Berufsreifeprüfung and then i startet studying mechanical engineering.
- I have no experience with data analysis but some experieance in programming primarily from first and second semester of bachelor studium
- i have to because its a part of 3rd semseter
- i would like to learn how to visualize data in combination with programming

## Technical Experience

### Programming Languages
- **Experienced:** [Unfortunately, I don't know any programming language ​​well]
- **Basic Knowledge:** [C++, Python]
- **Want to Learn:** [C++, Python]

### Tools and Technologies
List tools you've used:
- Git/Github/VS code are new to me i dont have any experience with...
- Data analysis tools (Excel, MATLAB,  Scilab)
- CAD software (SolidWorks, Catia V5)

## Course Goals

What do you want to achieve in this course?
1. [learn Python]
2. [learn visualize data]
3. [receive a grade]

## Sample Data Interest

Describe a type of engineering data you work with or are interested in analyzing:

- Imagine you take a lot of fotodiodes and put them on a board, each diode represents one pixel. Now you measure the resistance of each diode and calculate the candela brightness. Lets say we have 1000 diodes that means you have 1000 data. With this data we could visualize for example the light scattering of a car headlight. Very interesting, isn't it?

## Questions

List any questions you have about:
- The course content
- Programming concepts
- Data visualization techniques
- Tools we'll be using
